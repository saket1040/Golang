less than 30

“Thanks for the offer, but I want to be transparent I’ve been very clear from the start that ₹30 LPA fixed is my minimum, based on my experience and ongoing conversations.
I’m not in a hurry to jump, and I’m only looking to join where both sides feel the value is right.
If ₹30 or ideally ₹32 is possible, I’ll commit right away and join tuesday. Otherwise, I’ll have to pass respectfully.”

// But if things change, please feel free to reach out.

🎯 IF 30

Thanks again for the offer — I’ve really enjoyed the process and feel Pop is a great fit for me in terms of both tech stack and product direction.
I’m also in final talks with one more company, but I’d love to close this with Pop. If we can finalize the offer at ₹32 LPA fixed, 
I’ll commit immediately, stop all other discussions, and I’m ready to join as early as tuesday. This can give my decision more confidence.
I’m really looking forward to building things with Pop.


If not 32

“I respect that — just being honest, I’d hoped for ₹32 based on experience and current market. I’m genuinely excited about the role, but I’ll need to take a day to think and get back.”


💬 If They Say “We Have Budget Constraints”
“I understand. I’ve really liked everything about PopTech so far, and I want to make this work.
If there’s any flexibility at all — even a partial increase or early revision — I’d really appreciate it. But either way, I’m excited to come onboard.”


🪫 If they say: “We’re a startup, we can’t compete with funded players.”
“Totally understand that. I really respect the journey and want to be part of it. Since I’m ready to join immediately and fully commit, I just thought I’d ask for a little flexibility on the number — even if not ₹32, anything closer would help me decide today.”


If asked anakin final round
They took my final round in the second half on Friday, so I was expecting to hear today — but I’m honestly not waiting on them. I’m aligned with Pop and just looking to close things from your side.
If we can close at ₹32 fixed, I’ll commit immediately and can join this week

If they say something like “That’s too much, we were thinking 30”, then you can reply:
I understand — I’ve had multiple discussions align at ₹30, so for Pop I was really hoping to close at ₹32, especially given the fit and my readiness to join immediately.
But if ₹32 can’t happen, I’d still consider ₹30 as a final number if we can close it today.”

less than 30
Thanks so much for the offer. I’ve been aiming for ₹30 LPA fixed as a minimum based on my experience and other discussions.
If there’s any room to match that, I’d love to consider it seriously. Otherwise, I may have to pass for now.

If 30
Thanks again — I really appreciate the offer. I’m currently in final discussions with another company too, and since it’s a close call, I’d love a day or two to decide properly.
I’ll get back to you by tuesday morning at the latest.

🧠 If They Push You to Decide Immediately:
“Totally understand if you’re working with timelines — I just want to make sure I take a clear, committed decision and don’t flip later.
A day or two would help me give you a solid yes.

    NO
Hey! Thanks for reconnecting — since I didn’t hear back last week, I assumed there might be internal delays.
I’ve made good progress with another offer that matches my expectations, so now it’s really down to final numbers and clarity.





23 CTC
It’s not always mentioned on offer letters, but it’s a part of my total compensation and is discussed during goal setting. So I’ve always considered that my CTC.

True — but it’s structured as a performance-linked target, and most engineers at my level do receive a good portion of it.

So I factored that in when aligning expectations.”



I’m ready to join the next working day after we finalize the offer. If we close it today, I can join as early as tomorrow — Tuesday
